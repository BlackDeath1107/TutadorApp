 ## Inspiration
 Ever since we entered secondary or higher secondary level of education, we have been bombarded with terms like JEE, NEET, GATE and so on  which have confused us time and again. With the introduction of needing to secure a good Rank in national level competitive exams, we decided to provide a one stop solution for students where we generate automatic AI based percentile scores with the help of Machine Learning model training on a historic database of assessment scores. 
The website has been made in accordance with the problems faced by our peers to choose the appropriate road-map leading to the point where they can secure a good rank helping them to get into reputed institutions of the country. 
 ## What it does?
 We **minimize** your time and effort by bringing together all the information you need regarding your desired exam preparation. We take in your general data, like the highest level of education and the degree you want to opt for and present you with suggestive courses for a seamless learning experience. Those information are also used to search for study materials or video lectures that you need or want.  All in all its a simple way to start off with a stable competitive exam level preparation and for constant monitoring of your academic standing amongst your peers.
